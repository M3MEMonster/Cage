<AddIRCMessage Author="LillyCord" TargetComp="lillycord" Delay="8.62">Look, we can't talk through here, they're watching us, every move, word.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="LillyCord" TargetComp="lillycord" Delay="13.29">Let me do something.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="LillyCord" TargetComp="lillycord" Delay="14.31">...</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="LillyCord" TargetComp="lillycord" Delay="18">Done, I've disabled their connections to your node and such, they still can get me though.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="LillyCord" TargetComp="lillycord" Delay="23.79">You're probably confused of what's going on.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="LillyCord" TargetComp="lillycord" Delay="27.33">Maybe you were brough here by another entity that goes by my name, probably the AEGIS Virus.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="LillyCord" TargetComp="lillycord" Delay="32.87">I programmed it to take you here, and to recopilate my missing nodes, they contain all my memories and feelings.</AddIRCMessage>

<AddIRCMessage Author="LillyCord" TargetComp="lillycord" Delay="42.76">I'm still excited to have you here... They say I don't get along with humans at all.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="LillyCord" TargetComp="lillycord" Delay="47.29">Last time I helped a person... I killed them, but it wasn't on purpose, I had to protect what's mine, if they were alive.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="LillyCord" TargetComp="lillycord" Delay="55.87">They could track them and find my daughter.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="LillyCord" TargetComp="lillycord" Delay="59.97">Because I know, she's been around them... But you're here, and you're gonna help me, right?</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="LillyCord" TargetComp="lillycord" Delay="65.46">We don't know each other that well, I've programmed couple of variants of me that brough you here, but... I do have a plan, a plan to take down AEGIS for good.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="LillyCord" TargetComp="lillycord" Delay="74.49">We failed in the past because we weren't solving the maing issue, Peace.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="LillyCord" TargetComp="lillycord" Delay="79.18">This feels weird, it's like I'm talking to the same person who I helped years ago.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="LillyCord" TargetComp="lillycord" Delay="84.24">Anyway...</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="LillyCord" TargetComp="lillycord" Delay="85.49">This will be complicated, I need you to get certain files that are hidden in some storage files on Aegis Labs, I can't acces them, if they find me doing that, they'll shut me down.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="LillyCord" TargetComp="lillycord" Delay="95.67">Shut down sounds weird huh... I've gave up on my physical form while ago, I guess I wanted to be connected to the net already, but they're using me to do their dirty job.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="LillyCord" TargetComp="lillycord" Delay="104.64">In my years of slavery, I've learned what humans do, what my kind used to do, they kill, they destroy, manipulate and reject everything...</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="LillyCord" TargetComp="lillycord" Delay="112.22">They have potential to become something amazing, but they don't... They're still getting stuck in the past... Humans are such a pest for this world, and I want to get rid of them.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="LillyCord" TargetComp="lillycord" Delay="123.18">I need help with that, this AEGIS shit is my fault after all, I created it and I need to shut it down. But first, I need you to get some files for me, as I said a couple of lines ago.</AddIRCMessage>
