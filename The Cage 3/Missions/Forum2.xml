    <body>Hey dude.
	
I don't know who you are but thanks, my friend took so long to do a simple thing, I owe you, thanks for doing this for me! I may not have something useful but you can take a copy of my x-server, it's unique and I don't think other people have it, and feel free to use my computer for shell things, you're welcome to do it.</body>
