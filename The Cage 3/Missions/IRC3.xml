That was cool I guess?

I wanted to talk about something with you, but I didn't feel like talking about it on the IRC would be a good idea...

You know, things haven't been 'fine' in these days, something's up, something's wrong with this... Reality. Maybe I'm getting insane? That may be the most probably option. I need to check if this is real or not... I need you to go to my old backup server and see it by yourself, if you find anything about it it means this is reality and I shouldn't worry about the rest... If my backup never existed then we have a problem, I barely remember things... The ip was 162.144.x.x; I can't remember the last two digits but I'm pretty sure the first two may be enough for you to find a clue about the server. There are some nodes that still exist in my memory, I'll link them in this email, Once you find something I'll contact you.</body>
