My body may die, but my soul will live on. 
Perhaps up to heaven, maybe eternity, 
or be reborn as another, when I am set free.

Do not weep for me, for I will soon be gone.
I was a survivor since my first breath was drawn. 
I loved and was loved by animals and man, 
siblings, friends, and strangers since my life began.

I was blessed with a father who taught me well, 
to live this life on earth as a heaven, not hell. 
A mother who taught me to stand on my feet, 
a faith that anchored me, all strangers to greet.

If you fear dying, you'll not live a full life, 
as pain and dread will cut through like a knife. 
Live each day with joy while you're here on this earth; 
make each day count, with compassion and mirth.

Do not weep for me, for I will soon be gone,
my body may die, but my soul will live on. 
I leave all of you with my love, and I pray
that our souls will touch once again someday.</file>
