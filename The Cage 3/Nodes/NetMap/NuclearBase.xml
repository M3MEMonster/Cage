  <file path="home" name="ode_to_____.lc">She's a soft cool rain on a hot summer's day.
She makes me laugh with the funny things she has to say.

She's the beat of my heart, and the air that I breathe.
She's the sun and the wind, and autumn's golden leaves.

She's the pride that I feel when I know she's done what's right.
She's that warm feeling I get, when I remember tucking her in at night.

She is homework and sports, and a busy social life.
She has this beautiful smile that could light the darkest night.

She is the scared feeling I have when she stays out late.
Or the feeling that I am losing her, when she wants to date.

She's the mixed emotions I have, as I watch her mature and grow.
I tell myself she will never leave, but, I know in my heart that someday she will go.

I hope the person that steals her heart, will treat her like a queen.
Because she deserves so much more, than a person that treats her mean.

I will always cherish the wonderful times we have had.
The best part of my life was being her mom.

So now you know who she is, she's my little girl.
I love her with all my heart and I always will.
