  (cr4~ck3r):	hey dude the f*ck these guys from Aegis?
  (v1rus):		what do u mean.
  (cr4~ck3r):	their leader, is a pain in the ass yo
  (v1rus):		oh, is it because he's hacking into random computers?
  (cr4~ck3r):	yeah dude, that's not right, he doesn't even have a reason
  (v1rus):		hmmm, shall we warm the guys from accord?
  (cr4~ck3r):	I think it would be the best thing to do right now
  (v1rus):		also i've heard they got a new hacker, a very skilled one.
  (cr4~ck3r):	... what are we going to do then?
  (v1rus):		I don't know honestly, but this hacker was from Flux, remember Flux?
  (cr4~ck3r):	yeah, those guys are the sh*it, why would one of em join Aegis anyway
  (v1rus):		i'm pretty sure the hacker didnt, the hacker was forced, like the other members
  (cr4~ck3r):	sh*it dude, we need to do something, like NOW.
  (v1rus):		sure, check the IRC of accord, we have important stuff to talk about
  (cr4~ck3r):	see you there.</file>
