    <body>#PLAYERNAME#, I have a problem, while I've been busy, some keys of our server has been missin', I'm guessing
	that a hacker stole them to make profit with it and that's something AEGIS doesn't agree with, find the hacker and send me the
	codes, and if you want you can detroy their computer, that's up to you.
	
	I attach you our Drop server IP and the account so you can skip the hacking part.
