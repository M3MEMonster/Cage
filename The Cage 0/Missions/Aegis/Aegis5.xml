    <body>#PLAYERNAME#, You've been doin' great honestly, and now is your turn to help me.
	There are some banits that are harassing our projects and servers, and they won't stop
	unless someone f*cks with them. Here's where you get in, you need to enter their computers and destroy them.
	Also they apparently are connecting to a really famous Assets server, we need those assets, but one of them must have
	the password for the server, bring me the password and wipe those bastards their ~sys~ folder.
