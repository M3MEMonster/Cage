    <body>Heeeey girl :), so while I was watching what were you doin' for us, I wanted you to do something very quick for me, there's a server
	filled with invitation links, but it uses a Whitelist generator thing and I can't acces the server unless the Whitelist server allows my IP.
	I know the IP of the Whitelist server but I don't wanna risk it, I don't wanna get tracked, so I beg you to do this for me?
	
	I've linked you the Whitelist Server of the invitations Server, find a way to get into the Invitation server you'll find some files with the name
	"Invitation" on it but only the invitations to meet the famous artist Magic Axe and a VIP one, download the file and upload it to the filedrop.
