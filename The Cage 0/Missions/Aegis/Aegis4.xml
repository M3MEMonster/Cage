    <body>Hey kid, I've seen you've been busy with tyc00n, she always like to play with newbies like you, but I gotta a real big task for you.
	I need you to infiltrate a private server and steal some keys of an upcoming game called "Mortal Fighters", there are 4 keys in total, I need all of
	em. Help me and I'll give you a reward :).
