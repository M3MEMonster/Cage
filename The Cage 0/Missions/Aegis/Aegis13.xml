    <body>#PLAYERNAME#, it feels like you've been from aegis for years, even though your stay was short, this may be the final request I'll ask you
	(for now), I need you to acces a hospital server and I give me username and password for the Eidolon Security System, it should be somewhere in the database,
	plus I need you to download the records of some politicians that are now hospitalized in there and upload 'em to the drop server, after that, we will
	be finished and you'll be free to go back to FLUX, well, the remains of it.
