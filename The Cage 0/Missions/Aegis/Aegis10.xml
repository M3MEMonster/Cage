    <body>Hey #PLAYERNAME#, you've been doin' pretty well, I misjudged you honestly, and thanks to what you've done for us, I need you 
	to do something for me, well, for the rest too, I need you to enter a server which contains really good hacking software, although this server 
	is high in security so you may have to be fast and careful with the logs.
	
	I need you to enter and download a executable "SMTPOverflow.exe", It's really useful for opening ports 25, and upload it to the drop server,
	you'll do a enormous favour to us, I'm counting on you kid.
