<AddIRCMessage Author="Spiderbenb" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="16.58">Anyway Paulline though you guys needed help and that's why I'm here.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Spiderbenb" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="21.38">She told me about the deal with John and the VR Sets, and honestly once she told me that I had no choice but to join and help you guys stop that bastard.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Kaisa" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="30.43">And how the hell we are supposed to do that? We don't know anything bout him, not even a single IP.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Spiderbenb" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="36.64">I know, I know, it's going to be hard but apparently we're going in the right way, what do I mean? Raising Sun and maybe more corps are connected to him since they want only one thing, yes, the VR SET Source Code, John is not giving the S.C but his giving a sample set so corps can easily re-configure it.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Kwiper" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="57.01">So he doesn't want to show the Source Code for some reason right?.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Kwiper" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="62.68">I don't know about you guys but, if he's hiding something like that, it means something dangerous, and I'm pretty sure the hacker, is involved.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Kaisa" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="71.84">The hacker? what do you mean?</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Kwiper" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="74.84">Years ago, there was a hacker that broke into some politicians pacemakers and stopped them working, the reason is still unknown but that person now works for John.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Spiderbenb" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="84.54">Yeah, she's weird, we still don't know why she did that, but we won't let that frighten us right? Guys, I've joined you to help, and that's what I wanna do, no matter what.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Paulline" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="95.64">Spider is right, I have an idea... Let's make a decoy server.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Kaisa" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="100.38">What do you mean?.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Paulline" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="102.01">I'll make a node which disguises as a AEGIS one, this will contain a fake source code, and I'll publish it using a VPN, a real strong one.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Kwiper" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="111.88">Sounds like a plan, then what?</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Paulline" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="115.23">Well, corps will get into this server and will download the IP, so I'm going to track them and see if they're related to AEGIS, once I've digged enough I'll give you guys each one a corp for you to explore in okay? We're five people so this work may be easy and fast anyway.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Spiderbenb" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="131.96">Nice, I'll be waiting.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Paulline" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="134.65">By the way @#PLAYERNAME#, I need you to help me with something before we find out about the corps related to AEGIS, I've uploaded a mission for you to the hub.</AddIRCMessage>

<AddIRCMessage Author="Kwiper" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="10.60">That's a lot o:</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Paulline" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="11.78">Well yeah, I only got the IP's, they're encrypted tho, I'm gonna need an application for that and I'm not sure where exactly I can get it.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Spiderbenb" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="19.14">I know exactly the place, but it's a pain in the ass to get the file.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Spiderbenb" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="22.57">It's from a friend, but he's not giving anything to me or us, we gotta earn it.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Kaisa" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="26.54">How exactly?</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Spiderbenb" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="27.49">Simple as reaching his computer and getting the file directly from him.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Kwiper" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="30.48">It doesn't sound that complicated.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Spiderbenb" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="32.48">I know, I know, but that's the point, it looks easy but he's riddly as fuck. Most probably thing is that the files are hidden somewhere.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Paulline" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="38.59">This brings me memories from Aegis @#PLAYERNAME#.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Kwiper" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="40.74">Riddles.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Spiderbenb" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="42.74">Not sure though... I have the IP of one of his nodes, that may work?</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Paulline" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="46.90">Pretty sure that will do.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Spiderbenb" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="48.27">Okay give me a sec...</AddIRCMessage>

<AddIRCMessage Author="Paulline" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="56.65">Okay guys, let's do it.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Paulline" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="58.49">Oh and by the way, if you get the Decypher remember to upload it to the Drop Server.</AddIRCMessage>

<AddIRCMessage Author="Paulline" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="25.92">It didn't, the IP's themselves are encrypted twice the first lock is opened but the second one requires a password</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="Paulline" TargetComp="lunahub" Delay="31.91">Anyway I've stored the encrypted files in my backup server just in case. Also there you'll find my new program called DECHEAD.exe which tracks the IP of where the file was encrypted.</AddIRCMessage>
