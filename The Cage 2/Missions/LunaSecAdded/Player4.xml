So I've set for each of you a encrypted, you gotta track the IP of your assigned encrypted file, once you get the password to open the file inside there should be another password, I need that one, so when you're ready with it just reply to this email it, take your time #PLAYERNAME#.

I've linked you the backup server, you should find some useful tools there, good luck my friend.
