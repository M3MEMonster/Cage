    <body>Great.
	
You made it.

Honestly didin't believe at first you could do it y'know, people nowadays like action and not some dumb shit like puzzles and stuff, and that's boring, I wonder how many people got stuck in the Hidden Code.

Anyway! I gotta say, I'm impressed, but this is not over yet. wonder if you remember how to restore your x-server.

I'll give you a hand on this one, I made a node for the person who could finish my challenge thing, the IP is IPV10 so is not just a bunch of numbers... The IP for this server which contains an extra x-server is... "restore".

Prove me you can do this and I'll reward you with the Decypher.
Reply "go" when you're ready.
