After the break down of the the core server every 
hacker was disconnceted so they could come back to reality.

John Peace, founder of AEGIS, was arrested due to his actions 
towards innocents and he was put nn jail with a death sentence.

Sadly not all the hackers were able to disconnect, some of those poor souls died 
by the hands of John Peace

The rest escaped thanks to the breach into the core system, they're 
living their lives now.

Pauline weas the only survivor of your group of friends and she 
helped you get out of the facility.

Thanks #PLAYERNAME#, you've saved many lives today, 
now AEGIS won't be formed again.
