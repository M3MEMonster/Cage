Maritza, I need a break from the project already, I need to talk to the president about the future of this project and I'd like to ask you if you could take the lead for a few days.

	<email recipient="maritza4152" sender="John P." subject="RE: Absent">Of course boss, I'll do it without hesitating, back to the security stuff... I'm doing it right now! I just got stuck at the manual for a momento but now it should be set.
	
	Boss? Do you mind sending me the log information for the Assets Server? I've tried using mine but it won't work and I don't know why.

	I've reset your account password, it seems it was somewhat corrupted but that should do Miss, see you when I'm back at work, have a nice day.
