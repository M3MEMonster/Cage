Hey you're not supposed to be HERE.

You know what, since you're here and I got your IP, let's make a deal, a very important one.

John F. Peace is making a real drama about this AEGIS thing he's running, did you hear the news? Apparently not, no one does, it's confidential. Oh well, it's not that big of a deal.

He killed a person, while they were in the VR set, I'm pretty sure you know the person that was murdered? Yeah, the leader of the project himself did it with a single file and a executable, crazy huh?

The thing is, I hate that, I hate when people abuse their power to make bad things happen to innocent people... That just reminds me of Kael all those years ago...

Sorry... Look I don't wanna protect that fucker but I have to do it, why? He has my best friend connected to a Pacemaker and if I don't do what he wants, he'll kill her... If you can, please I need you to go into a server he made.

I want something deleted, a list and a dll called "euthanasia" that should do it.

Thanks in advance.
