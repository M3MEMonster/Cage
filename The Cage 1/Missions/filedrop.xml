    <body>First of all, good morning.
	
Second of all, I have really big news!

I've managed to create a Dropbox server for you to get files from customers or upload them, this feature was requested a lot so you may get contracts which requires the use of this new server, I really hope you're enjoying being part of the Support team, remember you're not gonna be here forever! You're just a tester, a valuable one, hope you have a wonderful day.
