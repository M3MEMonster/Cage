I need you to check the forums right now! I left a weird code that may be vital for us, It's on the Aegis forums, It looks some kind of morse code but I can't "translate" that in this OS, maybe you can? it would be funny if you've already discovered what it says.

There's nothing more I can do now, is up to you to find more clues, I'm out.
