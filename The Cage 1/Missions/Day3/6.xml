    <body>Hey #PLAYERNAME#.
	
You've been busy huh? Well, me too, when I saw Pauline was doing this Trials thing, it became viral in the whole server, so I decided I'd make one by myself. I really hope it goes viral just like the one that Pauline did.

Although I'm not sure what they were about, her trials I mean, but mine's about... Investigational skills. When you hack and achieve your objective instantly it's not that fun, sometimes it's more fun to make things a little harder by looking at every corner for possible clues, and that's what's my trial is about. I'll be giving you 2 servers, the first server leads to the end of the test but the security is unbreakable, you'll need to find a secret code, and that's why you get the second server. The second server is hackable and from there you'll have to find clues about the code.

When you're ready to go, reply with "go".</body>
