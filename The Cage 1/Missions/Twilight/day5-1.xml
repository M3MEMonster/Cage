    <body>So you're the newbie?

I need help with something important. A hacker tried to steal some files from me, I'm making a really cool software that allows you to instantly trace the IP of people by just copying the profile link of one person. This person breached and stole one of my dlls (the most important one) and I want it back.

I need you to hack into the hacker's pc, download a copy of the dll, erase the copy from the hacker's pc and upload another one into my PC in the ~home~ folder.
