    <body>Hello.
	
So I was working on a cool program, more specifically a hack to a super cool game called "Club Pigeon 2", my friends wanted me to make this hack so they could have infinite coins and stuff y'know. But, I don't have the time to give it to them and that's what I need you for basically.

I've uploaded a copy of the file to the Twilight Dropbox Server, it's called "ClubPigeonHack.exe", I need you to deliver the hack to my friends in their ~home~ folder, thanks in advance.
