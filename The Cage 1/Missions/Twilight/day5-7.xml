So the thing is, few days ago I took my last exam in uni and I'm afraid of what grade I got on it, well they're not announced yet, and I wanna ask you a simple task.

I want you to access my Uni database server and look for my grade and send it to me, you should look for the name "William Reck". reply with the grade I got okay? That'll put an end to this really annoying anxiety.
