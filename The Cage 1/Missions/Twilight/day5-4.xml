    <body>So.
	
You're the newbie, huh? Damn, I mean you need a lot of luck and skills to enter Twilight and I'm impressed. You're the one from AEGIS right? If you are well then I really hope you don't get disconnected, if you know what I mean.

Anyway, I need help entering a server but I don't know how, I mean I know the IP and all but my buddies gave me a "dec" file and I'm not sure how to decypt it lol, yeah I'm a failure of a hacker right?

Lol I've linked you the server and my pc, I need you to decrypt the file that's in my pc which should contain the password for the admin account of that server, I need you to test it, I need you to gain access to the server to make sure the password works.
