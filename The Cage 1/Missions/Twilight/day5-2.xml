    <body>Heyo.
	
So, I wanted to do something really basic but I cannot do it now, so that's why I need this little favor, I need you to enter my computer and delete a file, specifically the one called "AnimationCore.sys" located in the ~sys~ folder, why? because I'm working on something and that file is just being a bother there.

Thank you in advance, #PLAYERNAME#.
