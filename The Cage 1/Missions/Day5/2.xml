    <body>Hey.
	
Where the hell are you?

I'm trying to scan for your node but it doesn't appear on my Netmap. I worry abut you, you were... Well not so close but you were important for Johnny and he's still missing, I don't know where he is, remember, we cannot get disconnected from these things, apparently our bodies enter a stasis like state where we cannot feel hungry or thirsty, it's weird y'know.

Look, I believe you're alright okay? you're like the only other person I care about, and the last thing I wanna find out is that you were banned too. Honestly I don't know what being banned means in this program but I have the feeling that isn't a good thing.

Anyway #PLAYERNAME#, please wherever you are, stay safe, I almost got tracked by the AEGIS security system and I found out something that may be interesting: Even though our bodies are exposed for the authorities of the AEGIS team, we can still go incognito so they won't see what are we seeing, but the problem is, I don't know how to set that. If you find a way to do it, please tell me, I wanna do my stuff without feeling, watched.
