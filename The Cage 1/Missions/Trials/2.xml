    <body>Oh hey.
	
You've found my test server, and deleted the file, which means you're now capable of running my trials. They're not that hard, in fact, I'd owe you a favour with these, to train your hacking skills, lots of people tried to get into the server but honestly you're the first one that could do it.

Now that you've signed up for the trials, now it's time to start them, reply "go" when you're ready.
