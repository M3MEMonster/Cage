    <body>Hey #PLAYERNAME#!

So, I have this idea but it's a little risky, but the bright side, you'll have the tools to hack, because the only "legit" way to get them is to join the hub server, but who knows when this server is gonna online. I've been talking with other people, and apparently there is a server that's full of assets for us to use.

The problem is the login info, we got the IP, but the username is not admin, and we don't know the password either, also you cannot hack it, since it has a security inviolability. Look, once you get in, download all the exe files in the ~bin~ folder, and upload them to my server in the bin folder too.

I'll be waiting, I'm really busy now talking with the others, look for hints. There should be a way to get into that server without hacking it.
