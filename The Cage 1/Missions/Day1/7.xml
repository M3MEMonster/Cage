    <body>Good day.
	
I checked the IRC but I didn't have time to be there with you, my name is Pauline and you will probably see me in the IRC later. Right now I'm working on something very spectacular and I kinda wanted to share with someone since the others are offline and you seem to be the only one online.

Anyway, I really hope you enjoy our group, it's tiny but full of trustful people, including me, I love hacking and I found it very fun and useful sometimes, I joined with the goal of making my brother proud since I live with him. Why did you join the Aegis program? Any idea? I bet you joined cause you're some sort of cool person that can hack 5 computers at the same time LOL.

Nah but seriously, welcome to the team, or at least that's what I like to call it. Be careful with the staff computer, I checked and they have a tracker installed, which means leaving logs will result in them tracking you down and who knows what happens when you get caught, hopefully we'll never have to find out.

Okay, I'm getting very sleepy, this first day is exciting and full of stuff, it's like going to school again but a cooler school, you should take a nap or something too. See you later in the IRC, bye!
