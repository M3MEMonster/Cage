    <body>Nice.
	
This is gonna be quick, I need you to enter a server which contains a list of the users that may get "disconnected" when the "Big Day" arrives, I need you to find the list and DELETE IT. Also somewhere in his laptop there is a file named "euthanasia.dll" and I want that deleted too.

Doing this, the people that were supposed to die will be able to live once more thanks to you #PLAYERNAME#. 

Before hand, thank you.
