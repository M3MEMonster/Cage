    <body>Good day anon!
	
So, this is kind of a weird request, but I'm starting this thing of being a hacker, and my friends challenged me to get admin access to a really weird server, I tried to but I'm afraid I'll get tracked down, I know the IP, but maybe can you get the job done and reply with the admin password? Please, if I don't show my friends that I have admin permissions they'll kick me out of their group for being a coward, I swear this is the first and last time I'll ask a professional!
