    <body>G'day.
	
This is not a big deal honestly, it's just a little something I wanna do to a "friend" of mine, who stole a lot of stuff from me and I want him wrecked. He stole my account on Pointclicker and became famous with my account, I want you to delete his savefile with the name "Shely" so the bastard has to start from 0 again.
	
I've linked the Pointclicker website in the attachments, I await your response.
