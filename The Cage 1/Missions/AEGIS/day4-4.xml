    <body>Buenas.
	
I'd like some help with some malware in my system, apparently I beat a girl on a game and she got really mad at me, and apparently she's also a hacker, she just infected my computer with malware, which changed the admin password, forcing me to use a guest account, I'd like you to enter my computer, delete the malware and give me the password for the admin account.
