    <body>Good day.
	
I've requested a ticket to reach a skilled hacker to help me in this really weird task, this is not an ordinary one as it requires you to be very quiet about it. There's a code, divided in three parts, that code can launch missiles from the U.S Army, and they were stolen by some terrorist.

I need you to find the three codes and send them to me. I must add, this will be a very difficult task as we're not dealing with amateurs, this is a real hacking terrorist organization. Once you've done your job, let us know, we will reward you for your actions, someday.

      <note title="Strange numbers">Strange numbers were found in our logs, they must be some kind of I.P, but they're not in the standard IPv4 format, they're in a weird format, this is the IP that was registered in the logs: 31 32 38 2e 31 36 33 2e 32 2e 31, looks like some hex code, anyway, that's all the info we can give to you, good luck.</note>
