    <body>Greetings.
	
Hello anyone there? I've sent this support ticket because I need help with something... A guy blackmailed me and threatened to upload some personal photos of me to the surface web. I knew I shouldn't have taken those in the first place but I still need help with that, I don't have a way to reach them since they connected to my computer and I don't know anything about computer stuff.

I'd like you to find a way to get to that guy's computer and erase every pic related to me.
