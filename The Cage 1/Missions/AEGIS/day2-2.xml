    <body>Hey.
	
As soon I found out about this awesome program, I wanted to give it a try.

You see, I'm dealing with a person, specifically a hacker who is blackmailing me and my brother, we tried something but it didn't work very well, I'm not very good at hacking, but I am good at making really destructive malware. so I made a really nasty virus that will destroy that person's computer in no-time. The problem is that I don't know how to reach them, it would be awesome if you could to that for me.

I've uploaded the malware to your File Drop Server, it's called "AtomicBomb.bat" and I need you to upload it to the hacker's ~sys~ folder.
