    <body>Hey...
	
So the deal is... I opened a weird looking website and apparently it was a hacker trap, now the hacker has my IP and my pc is full of.. personal things, he's known to save his victim's IPs in a note for later use, so I assume the hacker already wrote down my IP somewhere in their pc.

I need you to enter the hacker's pc and find the note with my IP and replace it with "chicken", why chicken? 'cause why not? I've linked you the website.
