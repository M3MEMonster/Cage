    <body>Greetings dear #PLAYERNAME#.
	
Your support on the AEGIS team won't be forgotten, you've done us real good favour by helping me with this mini-project I made, I wanna thank you for all the time you spent with us, and all the clients you made happy, but it's time for me to say goodbye now.

You've proven yourself to be worthy member of AEGIS and I'll talk with our boss to see if you could get, y'know, promoted. I really hope you do, You must be really tired, maybe you should take a nap #PLAYERNAME#, Hope to see you around more often!

Dr. Maria Torres
AEGIS Support Team Leader
